No specific algorithm is used for generating random position of mines. I have used Math.random function of the Math Class of Java which generates a set of random numbers in a bound when run in a loop. Then I have put the mines in the respective positions.

            randomMinePos[i] = (int) (Math.random() * totalCol);
